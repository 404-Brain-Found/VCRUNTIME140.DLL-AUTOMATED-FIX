## 📋 What Is This?

A lightweight Windows batch script that **automatically downloads and installs** the correct Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable to fix the `VCRUNTIME140.DLL is missing` error — no manual searching, no confusing downloads.

### The Problem

Many applications and games fail to launch with an error like:

```
The program can't start because VCRUNTIME140.dll is missing from your computer.
Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.
```

This happens when the **Microsoft Visual C++ 2015–2022 Redistributable** is not installed on your system.

### The Solution

This script handles everything for you:

1. ✅ Automatically requests Administrator permissions
2. ✅ Detects your system architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
3. ✅ Downloads the correct installer(s) directly from Microsoft
4. ✅ Installs silently in the background
5. ✅ Verifies the DLL is successfully installed
6. ✅ Cleans up temporary files

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Download** the `VCRUNTIME140.DLL AUTOMATED FIX.bat` file
2. **Double-click** to run it
3. **Click "Yes"** when Windows asks for Administrator permission
4. **Wait** for the script to finish (usually under a minute)
5. **Restart** your computer if prompted

That's it! 🎉

## 🔒 Is It Safe?

**Yes.** This script:

- Downloads **only** from official Microsoft URLs (`https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/...`)
- Installs the same redistributable you'd get from [Microsoft's official page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
- Contains **no third-party DLLs** — it lets the Microsoft installer handle everything
- Cleans up after itself — no leftover files
- Source code is fully readable (it's a `.bat` file — open it in any text editor)

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>My antivirus flagged the script — is it a virus?</b></summary>

No. Some antivirus programs flag `.bat` files that request admin permissions or download files from the internet. This is a false positive. You can review the full source code yourself — it's a plain-text batch file.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>The error still appears after running the fix</b></summary>

Try these steps:
1. **Restart your computer** — some installs require a reboot
2. **Reinstall the application** that was giving the error
3. If the issue persists, download the installer manually from [Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this fix MSVCP140.dll too?</b></summary>

**Yes!** The Visual C++ Redistributable package includes both `vcruntime140.dll` and `msvcp140.dll`, along with other related runtime libraries.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I run this on Windows 7 / 8?</b></summary>

This script is designed and tested for **Windows 10 and Windows 11** only. It may work on older Windows versions but is not officially supported.
